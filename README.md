1. A brief overview of the origin of the Iris Dataset
The Iris Dataset was first discussed by Ronald Fisher, a British statistician and biologist[1]. He first published it in his article "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" in 1936[1]. It was collected by Edgar Anderson (therefore also sometimes called the Anderson's Iris dataset)[1]. 50 samples each were collected for the dataset from samples of Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor[1].
The dataset contains four features for each sample:
- the length of the sepals
- the width of the sepals
- the length of the petals
- the width of the petals[1]

The class of iris could be considered a fifth feature within the dataset[1].
Based on the data, Fisher was able to distinguish between the class using a linear discriminant model[1] because it is not possible to separate the class  using a linear model[3].
